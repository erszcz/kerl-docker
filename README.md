# Docker Kerl

This is a basic container with Erlang installed via Kerl.
It's intended as a base for specialization.

See Dockerfile for Erlang version and kerlrc for build-time options.

The Dockerfile is based on https://hub.docker.com/r/astachurski/docker-gocd/,
but with all GoCD related stuff removed.
